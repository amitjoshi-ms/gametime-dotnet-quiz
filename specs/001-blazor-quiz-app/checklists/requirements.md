# Specification Quality Checklist: Blazor Quiz App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-01-16  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Content Quality | ✅ Pass | Spec is user-focused, no tech details |
| Requirements | ✅ Pass | 13 functional requirements, all testable |
| Success Criteria | ✅ Pass | 7 measurable outcomes defined |
| Edge Cases | ✅ Pass | 4 edge cases identified with handling |
| Assumptions | ✅ Pass | 6 assumptions documented |

## Notes

- Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- All requirements derived from detailed architecture discussion
- No clarifications needed—feature was thoroughly discussed prior to specification
